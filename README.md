# UFOs
using java to track ufo sightings across the uso 
#overview
Helped to filter and search for ufo sightins, and allowed user to input their own date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO to filter thier search. Created an index.html file to display all coding that went into my app.js file,and  data.js file. These allowed me to pull, the data, reflect it in my html code and then filter it as desired. 

#Results
## deiverable 1 
 Using the site, one can look at the first page (without filters) below to see all sigtings the data has.

As indicated in the second picture, you can fill in the filters to narrow down the possible sightings.

#Summary 
## Drawbacks
One drawback of this webpage is that it does not have much recent data. Another is that it does not throw off an error when you filter to something that it cannot display. 
## Recomendations
To fix these issues, it would be a good idea to connect this to an api, so it can constantly pull the most recent data. You could also add in an error indictor if the search returns nothing. I think it would be fun to go a little further, and add counts of sightings over time for each search instance.
